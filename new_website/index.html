<p>So, My name is Giuliana as previously shown. That's my name that has caused many upon many teachers pronounce and/or spell it incorrectly. Fun fact about me is that I hella like space. I've tried even making a planetarium, but it was really not-good and we ended up calling it 'The Janky Planitarium'. But yeah, thats pretty much the outline of my person.
